## The challenge

**My app allows users to:**

- Easily create, read, update, and delete links, and instantly see previews displayed in a mobile mockup.
- Get helpful validations if they submit the links form without a valid URL or with an incorrect URL pattern for the platform.
- Effortlessly rearrange their links through a simple drag-and-drop feature.
  Enhance their profiles by adding details such as a profile picture, first name, last name, and email.
- Receive prompt notifications if they attempt to save the profile details form without entering a first or last name.
- Preview their DevLinks profile and conveniently copy the link to their clipboard for easy sharing.
- Enjoy a responsive design that adapts to the optimal layout based on their device's screen size.
- Interact seamlessly with all elements on the page with visible hover and focus states.
- **Bonus**: Store their details securely in a database
- **Bonus**: Create a personalized account and log in

## Continued development

This was my first fullstack project, and I'm incredibly proud to have successfully completed it. Throughout the entire process, from planning to development and hosting, I encountered various challenges. I believe this project represents my best work to date, and it's also the largest one I've ever undertaken. I'm extremely pleased with the results achieved.

Looking ahead, I'm eager to embark on even more ambitious fullstack projects while continuing to enhance my backend development skills. My goal is to always seek new knowledge and consistently improve the skills I already possess.
